                            Contributed to the stability and quality of a large-scale enterprise web application by identifying, analyzing, and resolving critical bugs in the development codebase. Utilized C#, .NET, and MVC architecture to debug issues, refactor inefficient logic, and implement scalable, maintainable fixes aligned with coding standards. Worked closely with QA and senior developers to triage issues, reproduce edge cases, and deliver solutions that improved performance, reduced defect recurrence, and supported smooth release cycles. Also participated in reviewing legacy code and documenting resolved issues to support ongoing maintenance.

                            A full-stack web application developed during my internship at Toast Inc. to manage employee records, roles, payroll, and access levels. Built with C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL, and REST APIs for backend services, and used React.js and CSS for building a responsive, user-friendly frontend interface.
                            Key features included employee onboarding, role-based authentication, payroll management, attendance tracking, and full CRUD operations. Emphasized clean architecture, secure data handling, and seamless API integration between the backend and frontend layers for efficient and scalable performance.

                            An interactive project that uses machine learning and facial point detection to build a hands-free virtual game controller. Leveraged head pose estimation techniques using ML libraries to track real-time head movements and map them to directional controls. Integrated the input system with a simple kart racing game developed in Unity, enabling players to steer and control the game using only head gestures. Focused on enhancing accessibility in gaming through computer vision, real-time input mapping, and Unity game integration.
